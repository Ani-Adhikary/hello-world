<h2> Hello </h2>


Pandemic 2020-21 made me realised the importance of family and when it started I was damn scared for the health and safety of my parents, but thankfully we are all good and doing fine.

I have spent 2 years in TCS Pune and I have a humble request to get a transfer to TCS Mumbai because my family lives there.

Staying at home is good for my mental and physical health. Also my parents are getting old and it's good to be along with them as they are a huge mental support for me.

Health wise I am quite fit but I am anaemic and have spells of fainting in the past.

I know transfers don't happen immediately and takes time but I hope that my request will be taken seriously and I will be considered for a transfer in the near future.
