<h2> Why it is not good to use WKWebView in iOS to play a video? </h2>

Using `WKWebView` in iOS to play a video is not recommended because `WKWebView` is primarily designed for displaying web content, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While it is possible to load a video file or embed video content using `WKWebView`, it has some limitations and drawbacks:

1. Lack of native video controls: Unlike using `AVPlayerViewController` or `AVPlayerLayer` from AVKit, `WKWebView` does not provide built-in video playback controls. You would need to manually implement custom controls using JavaScript or other techniques, which can be cumbersome and may not provide the same level of user experience as native controls.

2. Limited control over playback: `WKWebView` has limited control over video playback, such as seeking, controlling playback speed, or handling playback events. It is primarily intended for rendering web content rather than advanced video playback operations.

3. Performance considerations: Playing a video through `WKWebView` adds an additional layer of complexity and overhead compared to using dedicated video playback frameworks like AVKit or AVFoundation. `WKWebView` is optimized for web content rendering, and using it solely for video playback may result in less optimal performance.

4. Lack of seamless integration: `WKWebView` is not specifically designed for video playback, so it may not seamlessly integrate with other iOS features, such as system-wide media controls, background playback, picture-in-picture mode, and AirPlay.

In summary, while it's possible to play a video using `WKWebView`, it's generally better to use the dedicated video playback frameworks like AVKit (AVPlayerViewController) or AVFoundation (AVPlayer) in iOS for a more robust, native, and seamless video playback experience.

<h2> What is the preferred way to play videos in an iOS app? </h2>
The preferred way to play videos in an iOS app is by using the AVKit framework, specifically the `AVPlayerViewController` class. AVKit provides a high-level interface for video playback with built-in playback controls, fullscreen support, and seamless integration with iOS features.

Here's how you can play videos using AVKit in iOS:

1. Import the AVKit framework in your view controller:

```swift
import AVKit
```

2. Initialize an instance of `AVPlayerViewController` and set the video URL:

```swift
let videoURL = URL(string: "your_video_url")
let playerViewController = AVPlayerViewController()
playerViewController.player = AVPlayer(url: videoURL!)
```

3. Present the player view controller:

```swift
present(playerViewController, animated: true) {
    playerViewController.player?.play()
}
```

4. The player view controller will handle video playback and display the necessary controls automatically.

This approach provides a seamless and native video playback experience with support for standard playback controls, fullscreen mode, AirPlay, and integration with system features like picture-in-picture mode.

If you require more customization or control over the video playback, you can use the lower-level AVFoundation framework, specifically the `AVPlayer` and `AVPlayerLayer` classes. AVFoundation allows for advanced video playback, such as implementing custom controls, handling playback events, manipulating video assets, and more.

Using AVKit or AVFoundation ensures optimal performance, native integration, and a rich set of features for video playback in your iOS app.
